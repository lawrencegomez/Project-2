#PROJECT 2 IDEAS
- Image upload website, with sharing, liking, and comments
	- Images will be viewed in a scrollable deck
	- Add a way to send links to friends 
	- If possible to use googles Vision API for image data processing, when a user uploads a picture, it could be analyzed to see whether or not someone else has taken the same picture, and if so, when (uses the pictures location if stored in the meta data)
		- some sort of way to add another social aspect to it 
	- Use IBM Watson Visual Recognition API which seems to do very similar stuff as Google's Vision API 
		- Every picture uploaded gets categorized based off of how Watson analyzes the image
